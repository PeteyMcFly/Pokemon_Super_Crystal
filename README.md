# How To Play

## Automatic Setup
If you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running on your system, you can run a script to automatically install the custom tool chaining needed and generate a `.gbc` file.

```
chmod +x ./automate.sh; ./automate.sh
```

This will create a `pokecrystal.gbc` file in the root of the repository that can be used in any emulator.

## Manual Setup
You will need a Pokemon Crystal ROM (.gbc file). Please support the official release of pokemon and buy Pokemon Crystal. We can distribute the IPS patch for **Pokemon Super Crystal**, but not the ROM.

1. Download the IPS patch for **Pokemon Super Crystal** here: https://github.com/peterjtalen/Pokemon_Super_Crystal/releases/tag/rc1 An IPS patch is a set of instructions on how to alter a ROM file from its base form to the hacked form.
2. Download and install an archiver program if you don't already have one (Windows: 7Zip or WinRAR) (Mac: Keka) (Linux/BSD users: you know what you're doing).
3. Download Lunar IPS. This is an application that will take the **Pokemon Super Crystal** IPS file and use it to change a vanilla Pokemon Crystal ROM into **Pokemon Super Crystal**. *Mac users can download the MultiPatch application which does the same thing. Linux and BSD users are advised to use Floating IPS (flips).*
4. Open and run Lunar IPS and click 'Apply Patch'
5. Select the supercrystal.ips file
6. Select the Pokemon Crystal ROM (.gbc file)
7. Your Pokemon Crystal ROM is now patched to be a **Pokemon Super Crystal**  ROM. Load Pokemon Super Crystal with your emulator of choice (we recommend bgb). Enjoy!

Pokemon Super Crystal is a hack of Pokemon Crystal, built using the pokecrystal disassembly project. Super Crystal introduces many changes to the make the game more fun and challenging, and allows you to capture every pokemon without trading. 

Major changes include:
1. Can catch every pokemon
2. Physical/Special split
3. No need to trade to evolve
4. Pokemon available earlier on in a playthrough. All Pokemon except legendaries can be obtained before the Elite 4.
5. Many moves are only accessible via TM in gen 1, or through breeding. Everyone's level-up learnset is going to be altered to give them their strong egg moves, and many TMs from Gen 1 will be brought over like Swords Dance, Ice Beam, etc.
6. You no longer need to wait to evolve a pokemon to learn a certain move. ALL evolved pokemon can learn the same moves that their pre-evolutions can learn.
7. Trainers and Bosses will be significantly tougher, with stronger parties and smarter AI
8. Type Matchup Changes: Poison now super effective against Normal, Ice now resists water
9. Male and Female Pokemon are equally strong now.
10. Infinitely Reusable TMs
11. HMs moves can be overwritten
